							<p style="line-height:1.7em;">The main objective of developing this education loan management system final year project is to provide banking loans for student's education. Now a day lots of poor people of not able to provide better education for their children because of financial problems but with the help of this php base Loan management application they can apply educational loans for their children. Students can take bank loans with low interest rates by using this web application. This is Asp.net based project developed with SQL server database. This Project architecture follows with any student should register through the registration form appears in the home page and he can view different banks giving loans for education, if he/she finds any bank which is providing loans with low interest rate so that they can apply loan in that particular bank and finally the administrator of the application can issue the loan and transfer money in to his/her account. Most students and parents today realize how expensive an education is. Whether you hope to study at a private high school, a college, university, or an overseas school, tuition costs plus the costs of books and living can quickly add up. If you are worrying about the cost of school, you should not feel that money has to decide your education. If you want to study abroad in India, it is possible to obtain education loans. While getting these loans was difficult in the past, it has now become easier than ever before. A large number of national banks in India have created education loans. The terms of these loans will vary with each institution, so it is important to do your research before using them. Loans designed to help students pursue an education recognize that students should spend their school time studying, not working to repay a loan. For this reason, many loans created for students allow students to pay back their debts very gradually.</p>
